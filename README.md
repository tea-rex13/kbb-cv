## HTML5 linting

A local copy of the W3C HTML5 validator (`tools/html5-validator/vnu.jar`) is included so you can lint the main page without relying on external services. Run:

```bash
./scripts/lint-html.sh
```

The script reports any HTML5 validation errors and exits non-zero if issues are found.
